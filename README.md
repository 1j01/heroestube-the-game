# HeroesTube: The Game

A parody of YouTube Heroes and tounge-in-cheek extrapolation of the worst their [launch video][] could imply.

At first I'm doing the "Mass flag videos" level because it's the most obvious thing to turn into a game level.
(And the most worrying single feature, glossed over in the video with a person basically casually choosing videos to flag without literally any distinction between videos, if you take it literally)
